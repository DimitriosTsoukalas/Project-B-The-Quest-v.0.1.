About the content of the repository:
The content of the repository is just a short video that I have recorded using Debut Video Capture Software. The quality is mostly because of my laptop (it is an old one
but still it allows me to handle some Unity projects at the end).

To download the video:
Click on the Project B - The Quest - v.0.1..avi file that you can see above and then click on the "View raw" that you can see in your sreen.

About the game:
The game dives directly into a small adventure where the player has to find something. It is a very straightforward game that includes various elements such as: 
dialogue system, combat system, shopping system, inventory system, scene management, camera management and more.

Ending notes:
1. Feel free to ask for the files of the game. I would be more than happy to share. Due to the volume of those, I was unable to simply upload them in GitHub.
2. Once again apologies for the poor performance of the video

Thank you for your time! I really hope you enjoy!

The Developer
