About the content of the repository:
The content of the repository is just a short video that I have recorded using Screencastify. 

To download the video:
Click on the Project B - The Quest - v.0.1..avi file that you can see above and then click on the "View raw" that you can see in your sreen.

About the game:
The game dives directly into a small adventure where the player has to find something. It is a very straightforward game that includes various elements such as: 
dialogue system, combat system, shopping system, inventory system, scene management, camera management and more.

Ending notes:
Feel free to ask for the files of the game. I would be more than happy to share. Due to the volume of those, I was unable to simply upload them in GitHub.

Thank you for your time! I really hope you enjoy!
